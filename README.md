# NimNode [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tulayang/nimnode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tulayang/nimnode)

Library for async programming and communication. This Library uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model based on libuv. Furthermore, you can use ``Future`` ``async/await`` in the standard library to construct logical workflow to simplify programming tasks.

NimNode requires libuv library which should have been installed on your operating system. Releases are available as tags in this repository and can be fetched via nimble:

```sh
nimble install node
```

## Features

* Asynchronous timers
* Asynchronous TCP, UDP and HTTP streaming interfaces (NON_BLOCKING)
